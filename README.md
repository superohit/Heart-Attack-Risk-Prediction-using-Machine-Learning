# Heart-Attack-Risk-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Here we analyse the most popular dataset Framingham dataset taken from kaggle and predicts whether a patient has risk of Heart Attack or not. <br>
Framingham dataset kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aasheesh200/framingham-heart-study-dataset <br>
Here we use various models like:
1. Random Forest
2. Logistic Regression
3. K-Nearest Neighbors
4. Support Vector Machine
5. Decision Tree
