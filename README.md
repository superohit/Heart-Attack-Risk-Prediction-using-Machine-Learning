# Heart-Attack-Risk-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Here we analyse the most popular dataset Framingham dataset taken from kaggle and predicts whether a patient risk of Heart Attack. <br>
Here we use various model like:
1. Random Forest
2. Logistic Regression
3. K-Nearest Neighbors
4. Support Vector Machine
5. Decision Tree
